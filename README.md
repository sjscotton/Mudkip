# Mudkip
This Mudkip program is a silly unfinished game using pygame. It was built as a practice game after completing the "Alien Invasion" game walk through in the Book "Python Crash Course" written by [Eric Matthes](https://github.com/ehmatthes)

In order to run, you must have pygame installed on your computer. To install run pip install pygame.

To start the game run the following in your command line in the Midkip directory:

python moving_mudkip.py



##  Gameplay

Use the arrow keys to move Mudkip left, right up and down. Collect 4 types of berries of different rarities and point values. Although there are no penalties so far, avoid the raindrops to keep Mudkip dry.
